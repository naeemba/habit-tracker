This folder holds the project's kanban board, shown in the Dashboard app under Ctrl+B.

- `columns` is ordered. The first column is the leftmost on screen.
- The `Ship` column is not an ordinary one. Moving a card into it asks the
  Dashboard app to make a git worktree for that card, check out a branch named
  after it, and start an agent in one of the project's panes. Put a card there
  only when you mean to start it.
- A card's column on the `main` branch says what has been merged. While work
  is in flight the card's column lives on that work's own branch, and arrives
  here when the pull request does.
- `cards` is ordered. The first card is at the top of its column.
- `id` is a UUID, and no two cards may share one. Keep it stable when you edit a card. A card
  written without one, or with an id another card already used, is given a fresh one the next time
  the app reads the file.
- `title` is one line. A card with no `title`, or a blank one, is dropped when the app reads
  the file.
- `notes` is the card's description, free text over as many lines as you like. `e` opens it.
- `priority` is one of `urgent`, `high`, `medium`, `low`. Anything else, or nothing, reads as
  `medium`. It colours the card's left edge, and `s` sorts a column by it, urgent first.
- `parent` is the `id` of another card, or `null`. It is the only thing that makes a card a
  subtask: subtasks are ordinary cards that live in whatever column they are in, and a parent keeps
  no list of its children. A `parent` naming a card that is not on the board, or a ring of cards
  that are each other's ancestors, is reset to `null` when the app reads the file.
- `createdAt` and `updatedAt` are ISO dates, or absent. Absent means unknown, not now: a card written
  before these fields existed, or written by hand without them, stays that way and the app never
  fills them in on read. `updatedAt` moves when one of that card's own fields changes, and when the
  card moves to another column — reordering a column leaves it alone.
- `comments` is the card's comment trail, oldest first, or absent when nothing has been said. Each
  entry is `{ "at": <ISO date>, "body": <text> }`; `at` may be absent, and an entry with a blank
  `body` or no `body` is dropped when the app reads the file. It is append-only — write to it with
  `board comment` and never by rewriting what is there. `notes` is the card's description and is
  edited in place; everything said about the card over its life goes here instead, so recording a
  finding cannot take out what somebody else wrote.
- `branch` is the git branch the work is on, or absent. `pullRequest` is the pull request's number,
  a whole number above zero written without the `#`, or absent. Both are typed in — `b` edits the
  branch and `r` the pull request — and nothing fetches or refreshes them.

## The `board` command

Every pane the Dashboard app opens carries `DASHBOARD_BOARD`, the path to a command that edits the
board of the project you are in — any depth inside it, not only its root. It goes through the same
code the app does, so a card it writes is a card the app wrote.

    board — the Dashboard board of the project you are in

      board list
      board show <id>
      board add "<title>" [--column <name>] [--priority <level>] [--notes "<text>"]
      board move <id> <column>
      board set <id> [--branch <name>] [--pull-request <number>] [--priority <level>] [--notes "<text>"]
      board comment <id> "<text>"

    Levels: urgent, high, medium, low. An empty --branch or --pull-request clears the field.

    --notes replaces the card's description. To record what you found, use `comment`: it appends to the
    card's trail and takes nothing away. `show` prints one card with its description and its trail.

Run it as `node "$DASHBOARD_BOARD" <command>`. `list` prints the column, the priority, the id and
how many comments each card has — the id is the one `show`, `move`, `set` and `comment` want.
`show` prints one card in full, including its comment trail, which is the part `list` has no room
for.

Prefer it to editing this file by hand: a refusal comes back as a message and nothing is written,
where a hand edit that gets a field wrong is repaired silently on the next read.

Edit this file directly if you like — the app notices. It watches board.json while a board is on
screen, so a card moved from the command line or by hand shows up where you are looking, with the
selection left on the card it was on. The app rewrites the whole file on every edit and drops any
field not listed above.
